Refactoring Requirements:

1. Replace the multiplication operator (*) with a loop-based implementation
2. The loop should add 'a' to itself 'b' times when b is positive
3. Assume that b is always integer
4. New code must use PEP8 standard

NOTE !!! if your code includes calling some modules then add "import" statement on top of the code
